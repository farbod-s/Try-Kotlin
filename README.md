Kotlin
===
+ kotlin is an open source language
+ **Edu Tools** plugin from [kotlinlang.org](try.kotlinlang.org)

The Philosophy of Kotlin
---
A statically typed language for multiple application platforms.

+ Kotlin/JVM compiles to Java bytecode
+ Kotlin/JS transpiles to JavaScript code
+ Kotlin/Native compiles to native binaries

> **Statically typed languages**: A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. some languages offer some form of type inference, the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable.

> **Dynamically typed languages**: A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc.Most scripting languages have this feature as there is no compiler to do static type-checking anyway.

Kotlin Goals
---
### Concise
+ Reduces use of unnecessary declarations and keywords
+ Generates code that has to be explicit in Java
+ Semi-colons not required!

### Safe
+ Avoids entire classes of errors such as null pointer exceptions
+ Auto-casting of variables when checking types

### Interoperable
+ Kotlin/JVM code can be mixed with Java or any other JVM language
+ Kotlin code works both in JVM and in a web browser

### Tool Friendly
+ IntelliJ IDEA includes the kotlin plugin
+ Android Studio inherits Kotlin support
