The Philosophy of Kotlin
---
A statically typed language for multiple application platforms.

+ Kotlin/JVM compiles to Java bytecode
+ Kotlin/JS transpiles to JavaScript code
+ Kotlin/Native compiles to native binaries

> **Statically typed languages**: A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. some languages offer some form of type inference, the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable.

> **Dynamically typed languages**: A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc.Most scripting languages have this feature as there is no compiler to do static type-checking anyway.
